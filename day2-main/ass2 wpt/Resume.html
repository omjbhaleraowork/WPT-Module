      <br />“From the very start, Harry's main goal is always to
      <b>defeat Voldemort.</b> ” At the very start, Harry is all of eighteen
      months old or thereabouts. I don't believe an eighteen-month-old has a
      personal goal of defeating an evil wizard, even if that wizard murdered
      his mother right in front of him"
