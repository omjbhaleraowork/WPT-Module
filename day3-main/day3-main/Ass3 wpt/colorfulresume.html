    <p>“From the very start, Harry's main goal is always to <b>defeat Voldemort</b>. ” At the very start, Harry is all of eighteen months old or 
        thereabouts. I don't believe an eighteen-month-old has a personal goal of defeating an evil wizard, even if that wizard murdered his mother right in front of him"</p>
